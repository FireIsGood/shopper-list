# Shopper List

An list app for shoppers.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a
development server:

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Self Hosting

This app runs as the frontend of the app so you will also have to run dependencies separately on the same machine.
Probably.

To build the frontend:

```sh
npm run build
npm run preview
```

> To deploy the app for real, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target
> environment.
